# Understanding Translation Mechanisms
### By Punit Tak

This repository contains a training document designed for immersive learning on **protein synthesis (translation)** using EON XR. Explore the roles of mRNA, tRNA, ribosomes, and the genetic code in building polypeptides.

## ðŸ”¬ Topics Covered
- Central Dogma: DNA â†’ RNA â†’ Protein
- Role of mRNA, tRNA, and ribosomes
- Genetic Code (codons and anticodons)
- Translation phases: Initiation, Elongation, Termination
- Peptide bond formation



## ðŸš€ Built for
- Biology & Biotechnology Students
- Immersive Learning on EON XR
- Educators looking to teach protein synthesis interactively
